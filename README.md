# Machine-Learning-approach-to-predict-flight-arrival-delay
United Airlines has direct flights into Syracuse (SYR) from four cities: Chicago (ORD), Denver (DEN), Newark (EWR), and Washington (IAD). There could be more than one flight from each of those cities into SYR each day. The goal is to predict 1-4 days in advance if each flightâ€™s arrival time into SYR would be early, on-time, delayed, or severely delayed.
